# Focalworks

[![powered by hexdoc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://hexxy.media/api/v0/badge/hexdoc?label=1)](https://github.com/hexdoc-dev/hexdoc)

Focalworks is an addon that adds "rigged" foci. These have hexes that evaluate upon reading/writing, and can manipulate the iotas given.

Please suggest changes, this really isn't anywhere near what it should be.
